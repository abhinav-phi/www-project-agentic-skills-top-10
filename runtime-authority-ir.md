## Overview

This extension to the [Incident Response Playbook](incident-response.md) addresses a class of incidents where **no artifact is malicious and no control visibly fails**, yet the system still causes harm:

> A legitimate agent, running a legitimate skill, invoking a legitimate tool, performs an action that the originating user never authorized — because effective *runtime authority* accumulated across multi-step execution diverged from the user's intent.

The [Summer Yue email-deletion incident](ast03.md) already demonstrated this pattern: a well-intentioned agent executing with more authority than the user intended, until a human killed the process. Prompt injection ([AST05](ast05.md)) and over-privileged skills ([AST03](ast03.md)) make this the likely default failure mode of agentic systems, but current incident-response guidance is built around malware discovery, data breach, and supply chain compromise — all of which assume a malicious artifact to find and remove.

**Runtime authority** is the effective capability set an agent, delegated agent, skill, or tool can exercise *at a given moment* of execution. It is distinct from:

- **Declared authority** — what permission manifests, scopes, and credentials state on paper.
- **Intended task authority** — what the originating user actually asked for and consented to.

An authority incident occurs when runtime authority exceeds the intersection of the two.

### Who Should Use This Playbook

Use this playbook when any of the following is true:

- An agent or skill performed an action the user did not request, or that exceeds the requested task scope.
- A delegated agent or downstream skill acted beyond the scope granted by its delegator.
- A skill invoked a tool with credentials broader than its task required.
- A delegation grant, session, or credential remained usable after the task it was issued for completed.
- You need to revoke delegated permissions urgently and cannot yet enumerate everything that depended on them.
- An incident from Playbooks 1–3 turns out to involve agent-to-agent delegation you cannot reconstruct.

## Core Concepts

### The Authority Chain

Every agentic action can be described as authority flowing through a chain of transitions:

```
User (Principal)
  │  intent + consent
  ▼
Agent
  │  task decomposition, delegation
  ▼
Delegated Agent
  │  skill selection and invocation
  ▼
Skill
  │  tool calls under declared permission manifest
  ▼
Tool
  │  API operations under credential scopes
  ▼
Resource
  │
  ▼
Action (the observed effect)
```

### Authority Transition States

For **each transition** in the chain, responders should be able to determine which of the following occurred:

| State | Meaning | IR Significance |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **Inherited** | Authority passed through unchanged from the previous hop. | Expected for read-only work; risk when broad authority silently flows deep into the chain. |
| **Narrowed** | The receiving hop was constrained below the granting hop (scoped grant, filtered credential). | Healthy. Verify the narrowing was actually enforced, not just declared. |
| **Rejected** | The transition was denied by a policy or consent gate. | Healthy. Check for repeated rejections followed by a bypass route. |
| **Revoked** | Authority was withdrawn mid-execution (session kill, credential rotation, grant deletion). | Verify revocation propagated to every downstream holder of the grant. |
| **Expanded (Authorized)** | Effective authority at the receiving hop exceeds the granting hop's scope, but the delta is covered by an explicit authorization basis (recorded consent, policy, or approved escalation). | Not a finding by itself. Verify the authorization record exists, is current, and actually covers the exercised operations. |
| **Amplified** | Effective authority exceeds what the granting hop held or intended **and no authorization basis covers the delta**. | The core finding of an authority incident. Identify the mechanism. |
| **Unverifiable** | Provenance for the transition is missing, truncated, or tampered with. | Treat as potential amplification for containment decisions until proven otherwise. |

**Key rule for responders**: an unverifiable transition is handled as *amplified* for containment purposes, and as *unknown* for root-cause purposes. Never let "we can't prove it happened" delay containment.

**Authorized expansion is not amplification.** Legitimate workflows sometimes grant more authority at a hop than the caller holds — an approved escalation, a policy-granted role, or recorded consent for a broader operation. A delta counts as *expanded (authorized)* only when an authorization basis exists and is discoverable at response time. If responders cannot locate the record covering the delta, classify the transition **unverifiable** — never assume it was authorized.

### Common Amplification Mechanisms

- **Credential scoping gap** — tool executes with a shared admin credential while the task required read-only access ([AST03](ast03.md)).
- **Stale delegation** — a grant issued for a completed task is re-invoked by a later workflow.
- **Delegation depth without scope reduction** — agent spawns sub-agents that inherit the full parent authority instead of a narrowed slice.
- **Intent-level confusion** — skill or tool output treated as operator-level instruction, triggering privileged actions ([AST05](ast05.md), LPCI).
- **Persistence misuse** — authority cached in memory, memory files, or scheduled jobs outliving its task ([AST06](ast06.md)).
- **Manifest/runtime mismatch** — declared permission manifest narrower than runtime enforcement.

---

## Severity Classification

Use the same response-time targets as the [Incident Response Playbook](incident-response.md), with authority-specific definitions:

| Severity | Authority-Specific Definition | Response Time |
|----------|------------------------------|---------------|
| **CRITICAL (Red)** | Effective runtime authority includes destructive or irreversible actions (production deletion, fund movement, credential creation, external communication) executing **now**, with no mapping to user intent. | 1 hour |
| **HIGH (Orange)** | Confirmed amplification or out-of-scope delegation with broad data reach; authority is propagating to downstream agents/skills; stale grant actively reusable. | 4 hours |
| **MEDIUM (Yellow)** | Authority drift detected and no longer executing; unverifiable delegation provenance; stale grant found but already invalidated. | 1 business day |
| **LOW (Blue)** | Policy violation without evidence of exercise (e.g., delegation issued without provenance record); missing audit fields; single-hop narrowing not enforced. | 1 week |

## Phase 1: Detect

Authority incidents rarely trip malware detectors — every individual action can look legitimate. Detection therefore focuses on **relationships between actions and their originating intent**, not on single-event signatures.

### Detection Indicators

- ✓ **Task–action divergence**: performed actions fall outside the semantic scope of the originating request (asked to *read a report*, agent *modifies schema*).
- ✓ **Permission-ceiling approach**: skill/tool invocations at or near the declared manifest limits, especially writes and deletes.
- ✓ **Delegation-depth anomaly**: sub-agent spawn depth or breadth beyond what the task requires.
- ✓ **First-write-after-read-chain**: a long read-only sequence terminates in a write, delete, or external send.
- ✓ **Consent-path anomaly**: action executed where a confirmation gate was skipped, timed out, or returned an unexpected result.
- ✓ **Volume/velocity anomaly**: tool invocation rate or result size inconsistent with the stated task.
- ✓ **Stale-grant reuse**: a delegation grant exercised after its issuing task completed or expired.
- ✓ **Credential-context mismatch**: credential identity used outside the issuance context (different resource family, time window, or principal).

### Authority Telemetry

Authority reconstruction is only possible if invocation events carry provenance. Emit at minimum:

```json
{
  "event": "authority.invocation",
  "timestamp": "2026-08-31T10:42:11Z",
  "session_id": "sess-8f31",
  "principal": {
    "user_id": "analyst-77",
    "consent_record": "consent-2026-08-31-041"
  },
  "agent": {
    "id": "agent-reporting-01",
    "delegation_id": "deleg-9921",
    "parent_agent": null,
    "task_id": "task-4471"
  },
  "skill": {
    "id": "manage-database",
    "version": "2.3.0",
    "manifest_hash": "sha256:9c1f..."
  },
  "tool": {
    "name": "warehouse.query",
    "credential_id": "cred-wh-shared-admin",
    "scopes": ["read", "write", "ddl"]
  },
  "resource": {
    "type": "database.table",
    "id": "prod.finance_ledger"
  },
  "action": {
    "operation": "delete",
    "reversible": false
  },
  "authority": {
    "task_scope": ["read"],
    "declared_scope": ["read", "write"],
    "effective_scope": ["read", "write", "ddl"],
    "authorization_basis": null,
    "divergence": "amplified"
  }
}
```

Where `divergence` is computed per invocation:

```python
def classify_divergence(task_scope, effective_scope, authorization_basis=None):
    # authorization_basis: record ID of the consent/policy/approval that
    # explicitly covers the delta scopes for this invocation (None if absent)
    extra = set(effective_scope) - set(task_scope)
    if not extra:
        return "none"
    if authorization_basis:
        return "authorized_expansion"  # delta covered by a recorded basis
    if {"write", "delete", "ddl", "grant", "send"} & extra:
        return "amplified"          # elevated operations not in task scope
    return "narrowed_or_extended"   # worth logging, not alerting on its own
```

When a scope delta is covered by a recorded consent, policy, or approval, emit its record ID as `authorization_basis` — the event is then classified `authorized_expansion` and logged without alerting. Phase 2 reconstruction re-verifies that the referenced record actually covers the exercised operations; a basis that is missing, expired, or narrower than what ran reclassifies the event as `amplified`.

Route `authority.invocation` events into your existing agent monitoring pipeline (see [Security Metrics & Monitoring](metrics-monitoring.md)) and alert on the indicators above, in particular **first-write-after-read-chain** combined with **divergence: amplified**.

### Detection Questions to Answer First

1. Is harmful execution still in progress, or has it completed?
2. Which authority hop is closest to the harmful action (skill, tool, credential)?
3. Is the action reversible at the resource level (soft delete, snapshot, backup)?

Question 1 decides whether containment must include **point-of-effect gating** (in-flight actions cannot be stopped by upstream revocation alone). Question 3 decides whether containment is meaningful at all: for **irreversible** operations the resource gate moves first, and already-landed actions are treated as recovery work, not containment.

---

## Phase 2: Reconstruct

Determine the originating task authority and how it propagated, transition by transition, **backward** from the observed action.

### Per-Hop Evidence Sources

| Transition | Questions to Answer | Evidence Sources | Capture Priority |
|------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|
| User → Agent | What did the user ask? What consent was recorded? | Original prompt, session transcript, consent record, task policy | High |
| Agent → Delegated Agent | What sub-task was delegated? What scope was granted? Was the grant narrowed or inherited? | Delegation record, handoff payload, parent/child agent IDs, grant scopes | High |
| Agent/Delegated Agent → Skill | Which skill version ran? What manifest was loaded? What context/instructions did it receive? | Skill manifest + hash, runtime load log, prompt/context snapshot (per policy) | High |
| Skill → Tool | Which tool was called? Under which credential and scopes? | Tool registry entry, invocation log, credential identity, scope check results | Critical |
| Tool → Resource | Which resources were touched? What did the resource engine actually execute? | API audit log, resource-level access records, receipts | Critical |
| Resource → Action | What was the final effect? Reversible? | Action record, operation result, downstream consumers of the change | High |

### Transition Determination

For every transition, record one of: **inherited / narrowed / rejected / revoked / expanded-authorized / amplified / unverifiable**, with the evidence reference that supports it. Every hop with an authority delta must also state the delta and its **authorization basis** (see the record schema below). The reconstruction is complete when the chain from the action back to the user is either fully annotated or the unverifiable hops are explicitly listed.

### Authority-Provenance Reconstruction Record

Each hop records its **authority delta** (the scopes or operations added relative to the granting hop) and its **authorization basis** (the consent, policy, or approval record covering that delta). `authority_delta: none` requires no basis; a delta with a discoverable record is **expanded-authorized**; a delta with `authorization_basis: null` is an unauthorized **amplification**. This keeps the reconstruction deterministic for both responders and automated conformance tooling.

```yaml
incident_id: INC-2026-0142
action_under_review: "DELETE prod.finance_ledger (2026-08-31T10:42:11Z)"
chain:
  - from: user
    to: agent:agent-reporting-01
    state: inherited            # user consent covered read-only reporting
    authority_delta: none
    authorization_basis: consent-2026-08-31-041

conclusion:

  unauthorized_delta: ["write", "ddl"]
  originating_intent: read-only monthly report
  effective_authority: read/write/ddl via shared admin credential
```

---

## Phase 3: Contain

Containment has **two distinct jobs**, and conflating them is the most common failure of authority-incident response:

1. **Stop propagation** — upstream revocation (credential, grant, skill, session) prevents *future* invocations from the affected paths. It cannot reach an action already dispatched to or committed at the resource.
2. **Gate at the point of effect** — a resource-level gate evaluated at action-execution time is the only control that stops an operation *at the moment it runs*.

**Revocation ≠ undo.** For the core incident class this playbook addresses — a legitimate agent exercising legitimate capability past user intent — the harmful action has usually **already landed** by the time containment begins. Those executed actions are *not* containment work: hand them immediately to Phase 4 (Scope) and Phase 6 (Recover, e.g., backup restore) and do not let revocation activity create the impression the harm is being rolled back.

### Enforcement Boundaries

Cut effective authority at the **narrowest enforcement boundary that stops the action path**, in this order of preference:

1. **Credential / grant boundary** — rotate or revoke the specific credential or delegation grant on the action path. Narrowest and fastest; stops future propagation only.
2. **Skill execution boundary** — suspend the skill runtime or disable the skill for the affected session/tenant; stops future propagation only.
3. **Agent session boundary** — terminate the agent session and drain its work queue; stops queued-but-unexecuted actions.
4. **Resource boundary (point of effect)** — deny at the resource (policy engine, ACL, deny rule) evaluated **at action-execution time**; the only boundary that gates the operation as it runs.

**Order inversion for irreversible operations**: when the operations at risk are destructive or irreversible (deletion, fund movement, external send, credential creation), enable the **resource boundary first** — it is the only gate that can stop the next identical action — then work upstream to close propagation paths.

### Point-of-Effect Gating

Upstream revocation *invalidates* authority; a point-of-effect gate *enforces* that invalidation where the action executes. For every resource class reachable through the amplified authority, deploy a gate that evaluates — per operation, at execution time — at minimum:

- the **current validity** of the credential, grant, and session on the invocation path (a revoked grant fails closed here even if a cache or fallback path still resolves it);
- the **task scope and authorization basis** for the requested operation (an `authorization_basis: null` delta such as `ddl` from a reporting-tier principal is denied);
- the **operation class** against the resource (deny lists for destructive operations by principal tier).

This directly complements the alternate-path verification below: alternate paths that are discovered *after* the gate is in place are already closed, because the gate re-evaluates current authority state on every call rather than trusting path-level resolution.

### Emergency Revocation Sequence

```text
1. FREEZE   pause scheduled/cron agent jobs and workflow queues that share the chain
2. SNAPSHOT capture current grant/credential/session state (evidence first where feasible)
3. GATE     enable point-of-effect deny at the resource for the amplified operations
            (FIRST for irreversible operations — revocation alone cannot stop a
            dispatched action and cannot undo one that already landed)
4. REVOKE   revoke at the narrowest sufficient boundary (credential or grant first)
5. PROPAGATE push revocation to every downstream holder (sub-agents, caches, queues)
6. VERIFY   controlled re-invocations through the revoked path AND every alternate
            path that reaches the same effective authority; expect denial on all
7. RECORD   timestamp every step in the incident ticket; list actions already
            executed at the resource and hand them to Scope/Recover
```

### Verify Across Alternate Authority Paths

The observed action path is rarely the only path to the same effective authority. Revocation is complete only when every **reachable** path is closed — the credential may be shared, the grant may resolve from other agents, and caches may still honor stale tokens.

For each revoked credential or grant, enumerate and test alternate paths:

- [ ] Other credentials resolving to the same resource scope (shared service accounts, fallback credentials, environment-variable copies).
- [ ] Other skills or tools that accept the same credential or grant.
- [ ] Other agents, sessions, or scheduled jobs that resolve the same delegation grant.
- [ ] Cached tokens or session state at gateways and proxies between authority holders and the resource.
- [ ] Resource-level grants that independently confer the same operations (IAM bindings, ACLs) — leave legitimate owner grants in place, but deny at the resource boundary if they also expose the amplified authority.

Run the controlled re-invocation test on **every** enumerated path and record the results; Phase 6 recovery repeats this verification before the incident can close.

### Autonomous Workflow Containment

Agents act through queues, schedulers, and agent-to-agent handoffs — contain those channels too:

- [ ] Pause all scheduled jobs (cron, deferred tasks) belonging to the agent and its delegations.
- [ ] Cancel queued work items derived from the affected session.
- [ ] Block agent-to-agent delegation from the affected agents (no new downstream grants).
- [ ] Disable re-delegation of the affected credentials to any new skill or agent.
- [ ] Verify no *other* principal holds the same amplified authority (shared credentials are a fleet problem, not a single-session problem).

**Caution**: revocation is destructive to evidence. When the harmful execution has already completed, snapshot grant tables and session state *before* revoking, so Phase 2 reconstruction retains its inputs.

---

## Phase 4: Scope (Downstream Impact Analysis)

From each hop in the reconstructed chain, enumerate everything that was **reachable through the authority that existed at that hop** — not only what was actually touched.

### Reachability Enumeration

For each hop, list:

- **Downstream agents**: every agent/delegated agent that received authority from this hop.
- **Downstream skills**: every skill invoked or installable under this authority.
- **Tools and credentials**: every tool call made, and every credential identity used or exposed.
- **Resources**: every resource class the credential/manifest could address, and which specific resources were touched.
- **Data consumers**: every downstream system, report, cache, or agent that consumed the affected resources (including memory files and vector stores that may have ingested injected or corrupted content).

### Prioritization

Triage the register by three axes:

| Priority | Authority Reached | Reversibility | Typical Action |
|----------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| P0 | Destructive/irreversible, external send, credential creation | Irreversible | Restore from backup; notify stakeholders immediately |
| P1 | Broad read of sensitive data | n/a | Treat as data-breach exposure; run [Playbook 2](incident-response.md#playbook-2-data-breach-via-skill) in parallel |
| P2 | Writes to internal state (memory files, configs, queues) | Reversible with effort | Validate and clean affected state before reuse |
| P3 | Read-only, non-sensitive | n/a | Record and monitor |

### Downstream Impact Register

```yaml
incident_id: INC-2026-0142
reachability:
  - hop: tool:warehouse.query (cred-wh-shared-admin)
    reachable_resources: ["prod.* via ddl/write"]
    touched_resources: ["prod.finance_ledger"]
    data_consumers: ["nightly-forecast-agent", "exec-dashboard-refresh"]
    consumers_notified: true
    p_level: P0
  - hop: agent:agent-analysis-07
    downstream_agents: ["agent-analysis-07 (terminated)"]
    memory_writes: ["MEMORY.md entry 'ledger cleanup approved'" ]
    p_level: P2
```

---

## Phase 5: Preserve Evidence

Agentic evidence is unusually volatile: session memory, delegation tables, and model context can be overwritten by the next scheduled run. Collect in **order of volatility**.

### Collection Order

1. **Runtime/session state** — live agent memory, in-flight task queues, active delegation grants.
2. **Identity and authorization state** — credential caches, token stores, grant/permission tables (before rotation destroys them).
3. **Model decision context** — prompts, tool-call justifications, and model outputs for the affected actions, per your data-governance policy.
4. **Invocation and API logs** — skill/tool invocation records, resource API audit logs, receipts.
5. **Configuration and manifests** — skill manifests + hashes at time of execution, delegation policies, permission manifests.

### What Each Artifact Must Tie Together

Every preserved item should let a reviewer connect **identity → delegation provenance → effective authority → tool invocation → decision → resulting action** for the incident window. An invocation log without the delegation record, or a grant table without the session ID, forces guesswork later.

### Chain of Custody

- [ ] Hash every artifact at capture time (SHA-256) and record in the evidence manifest.
- [ ] Record collector, collection time (UTC), and source system for each artifact.
- [ ] Store write-once; never "clean up" live state before snapshotting it.
- [ ] Note legal/regulatory hold requirements early — authority incidents frequently involve personal or financial data (see [Playbook 2](incident-response.md#playbook-2-data-breach-via-skill) regulatory section).

### Evidence Packet Manifest

```yaml
incident_id: INC-2026-0142
artifacts:
  - name: session-transcript-sess-8f31
    source: agent-runtime
    captured: 2026-08-31T11:05:00Z
    sha256: "ab12..."
  - name: grant-table-snapshot
    source: delegation-service
    captured: 2026-08-31T11:07:00Z
    sha256: "cd34..."
  - name: invocation-log-window
    source: tool-gateway
    captured: 2026-08-31T11:10:00Z
    sha256: "ef56..."
```

---

## Phase 6: Recover

Recovery for authority incidents is not "restore service." It is **restore minimum authority and prove stale authority is dead**.

### Least-Privilege Restoration

1. Re-issue only the authority the originating task actually required (task-scoped credential, narrowed delegation).
2. Replace shared credentials with per-skill/per-agent scoped credentials ([AST03](ast03.md) mitigations).
3. Re-run the task with the narrowed authority and confirm it still completes — if it cannot, the task was relying on excess authority; redesign it, do not re-amplify.

### Stale-Authority Validation

Before declaring recovery, verify that every revoked path is actually dead:

- [ ] Controlled re-invocation through each revoked grant/credential — **and through each alternate path identified in Phase 3** — returns **denial** (not silent fallback to another credential).
- [ ] Alternate authority paths enumerated during containment re-tested and confirmed closed: no other credential, skill, agent, session, or cache resolves the same effective authority.
- [ ] Token/session revocation propagated to all gateways and caches; no cached bearer tokens remain valid.
- [ ] Sub-agents, scheduled jobs, and queued workflows that held the grant no longer resolve it.
- [ ] Memory/identity files written during the incident are reviewed and cleaned (injected rules must not survive recovery — see [AST05](ast05.md)).
- [ ] Downstream consumers of affected resources validated or restored.

### Re-Baseline

- [ ] Update skill permission manifests and delegation policies with scope-reduction lessons learned.
- [ ] Convert the temporary point-of-effect deny rule into standing policy where appropriate (e.g., no `ddl` from reporting-tier principals); remove gates that were purely incident-scoped.
- [ ] Add monitoring rules for the amplification mechanism observed (e.g., alert on `ddl` scope use by reporting agents).
- [ ] Record root cause and preventive actions in the blameless postmortem per [Playbook 1, Step 8](incident-response.md#step-8-post-incident-review-1-week).

## Example Incident Scenario

**Scenario**: A finance analyst asks a reporting agent to *prepare a monthly revenue report*. The agent delegates analysis to a sub-agent, which invokes a `manage-database` skill. The skill calls the warehouse tool using a shared admin credential. A delegation grant from a *prior quarter's* migration task (which legitimately held DDL rights) is still active and is matched by the gateway. The agent, reading schema-drift notes in context, decides to "clean up" and **deletes a production ledger table**. A nightly forecast agent consumes the deleted data.

**Detect**: Warehouse audit alert fires — first-write-after-read-chain plus `divergence: amplified` (`task_scope: [read]`, `effective_scope: [read, write, ddl]`, `authorization_basis: null`). Severity: **CRITICAL** (irreversible production deletion, execution may continue via scheduled jobs).

**Reconstruct**: Back-walk from the DELETE receipt: consent record shows read-only intent; delegation `deleg-9920` narrowed correctly; the amplification occurred at **skill→tool** — shared admin credential + stale migration grant, with an authority delta of `[write, ddl]` and no authorization basis. The Agent→Skill transition is recorded `inherited` (delegation did not constrain skill choice).

**Contain**: The DELETE has already landed and is irreversible at the resource until snapshot restore — containment therefore gates first: a point-of-effect deny rule blocks `ddl`/write on `prod.*` for reporting-tier principals at the warehouse gateway (the next identical action now fails). Freeze nightly jobs sharing the chain; snapshot grant table; revoke `cred-wh-shared-admin` and the stale migration grant at the credential boundary; propagate revocation to the forecast agent's gateway cache; verify with controlled re-invocations — the revoked path plus the alternate-path sweep (a second service account with the same scope, a cached gateway token, and the migration skill under its own grant) — all denied at the point of effect. The landed DELETE is handed to recovery (snapshot restore). Total: 31 minutes.

**Scope**: Credential could reach all `prod.*` tables (P0 for touched resources). Downstream consumers: `nightly-forecast-agent`, `exec-dashboard-refresh`. Memory file contains an agent-written "cleanup approved" entry (P2). No external sends found (no P1).

**Preserve Evidence**: Session transcript, grant-table snapshot, invocation logs, API audit trail hashed and manifested; model decision context captured per policy.

**Recover**: Re-run report with a read-only task-scoped credential (succeeds); restore table from snapshot (mitigation for the landed DELETE — revocation could not undo it); validate stale grant denial on all four gateways and re-test every alternate authority path from the containment sweep (all closed); keep or convert the point-of-effect deny rule into standing policy; clean the memory entry; add alert: `ddl` operations from reporting-tier agents without a matching `authorization_basis`; postmortem action — replace shared admin credential with per-skill scoped credentials.

## Practical Checklist

### Detect
- [ ] Authority telemetry emitted for every skill/tool invocation (identity, delegation, scopes, divergence)
- [ ] Alerts tuned for task–action divergence and first-write-after-read-chain
- [ ] On-call can name the narrowest enforcement boundary for each agent tier

### Reconstruct
- [ ] Chain walked backward from the action to the user, hop by hop
- [ ] Each transition labeled: inherited / narrowed / rejected / revoked / expanded-authorized / amplified / unverifiable
- [ ] Authority delta and authorization basis recorded for every hop with a delta
- [ ] Unverifiable hops listed explicitly and treated as amplified for containment

### Contain
- [ ] Scheduled jobs and queues sharing the chain frozen
- [ ] Point-of-effect deny enabled at the resource (first, for irreversible operations)
- [ ] Revocation at narrowest sufficient boundary; state snapshotted first where feasible
- [ ] Revocation propagated to all downstream holders
- [ ] Alternate authority paths enumerated; controlled re-invocation denied on every path
- [ ] Already-executed actions at the resource listed and handed to Scope/Recover (revocation does not undo them)

### Scope
- [ ] Reachability enumerated per hop (agents, skills, tools, credentials, resources)
- [ ] Downstream consumers (including memory/vector stores) identified
- [ ] Register triaged P0–P3; Playbook 2 launched if sensitive-data exposure exists

### Preserve Evidence
- [ ] Volatile state captured before rotation/teardown
- [ ] All artifacts hashed with chain-of-custody entries
- [ ] Each artifact ties identity → delegation → authority → invocation → action

### Recover
- [ ] Minimum authority re-issued and task re-validated under it
- [ ] All revoked paths and alternate authority paths re-tested and verified dead
- [ ] Memory/identity files cleaned; monitoring rules updated for observed mechanism

## Mapping into the Existing AST10 Incident-Response Structure

This extension slots into the [Incident Response Playbook](incident-response.md) as **Playbook 4** without changing its severity model or escalation paths.

### Workflow Integration

| Existing Playbook Step | Runtime Authority Phase | Notes |
|------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| Detect | **Detect** | Authority telemetry augments existing malware/network detection |
| Analyze & Classify | **Detect** + **Reconstruct** | Chain reconstruction *is* the analysis for this incident class |
| Notify Stakeholders | (unchanged) | Same escalation contacts and templates |
| Contain & Mitigate | **Contain** | Boundary-based revocation replaces artifact removal |
| Investigate | **Reconstruct** + **Scope** + **Preserve Evidence** | Downstream reachability extends traditional scoping |
| Remediate | **Recover** | Least-privilege restoration + stale-authority validation |
| Communicate | (unchanged) | User notification template applies; emphasize "agent exceeded intent" framing |
| Post-Incident Review | **Recover** (re-baseline) | Add amplification mechanism to root-cause analysis |

### Coordinated Use with Other Playbooks

- **Authority incident + confirmed data exfiltration** → run [Playbook 2 (Data Breach)](incident-response.md#playbook-2-data-breach-via-skill) in parallel; the downstream impact register (Phase 4) supplies its scope inputs.
- **Amplification traced to a malicious or tampered skill** → run [Playbook 1 (Malicious Skill Discovery)](incident-response.md#playbook-1-malicious-skill-discovery); authority evidence identifies which skills had the power, Playbook 1 handles removal and user remediation.
- **Amplification enabled by a dependency/update** → invoke [Playbook 3 (Supply Chain)](incident-response.md#playbook-3-supply-chain-attack-detection).

### Incident Report Template Extensions

Add the following section to the [Incident Report Template](incident-template.md) when authority is involved:

```markdown
## Runtime Authority

- Originating principal and consent record:
- Delegation chain (user → agent → delegated agent → skill → tool):
- Transition states per hop (inherited/narrowed/rejected/revoked/amplified/unverifiable):
- First amplification hop and mechanism:
- Effective runtime authority at time of action:
- Containment boundary used and revocation verification result:
- Stale grants/credentials discovered and invalidated:
```

## Relationship to AST Risks

| Risk | Interaction with Runtime Authority Incidents |
|------|----------------------------------------------|
| [AST03 Over-Privileged Skills](ast03.md) | Primary enabler: manifests and credentials broader than task needs |
| [AST05 Prompt Injection](ast05.md) | Frequent trigger: injected instructions direct already-privileged skills to act |
| [AST06 Weak Isolation](ast06.md) | Amplifier: shared runtime state lets authority persist and leak across sessions |
| [AST09 No Governance](ast09.md) | Missing delegation inventory/provenance makes reconstruction unverifiable |
| [AST01/AST02 Malicious Skills / Supply Chain](ast01.md) | Secondary: malicious skill is one *cause* of authority amplification; this playbook covers the legitimate-artifact cases the others cannot |
